Implementing different architectures of deep learning (CNN, RNNs, Transformers) for the text classification problem

The data folder contains the train and test data used to build and evaluate different models
The code folder contains the jupyternotebooks of different architectures
1. notebook with different machine learning methods and their performance validations
2. note book with CNN and different architectures and their performance
3. note book with RNN and different variants and their performance
4. note book with pretrained Tranformer architectures

Final report contains the detailed analysis of all the methods and algorithms
